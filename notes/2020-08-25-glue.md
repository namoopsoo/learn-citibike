#### troubleshoot docker does not run serve command...
- is it not executable? Wrong work dir?

```
$ docker run -p 8889:8889 -p 8080:8080 -i -t -v $(pwd):/opt/program       \
      -v ${my_local_data_directory}:/opt/data        \
      -v   ~/Downloads:/opt/downloads         \
      -v  $(pwd)/artifacts/2020-08-19T144654Z:/opt/ml   citibike-learn:latest  serve

docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:349: starting container process caused "exec: \"serve\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown.



```

* Maybe some help [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27158840/docker-executable-file-not-found-in-path) , or [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/cmd)  , with the use of a `CMD` word in the `Dockerfile` .
