In this notebook, taking another visual approach to do some EDA on the time_of_day feature.
I am looking at this after already having done a good deal of model training. Perhaps if I had looked at this histograms below earlier, I would have not necessarily chosen this particular feature binned as arbitrarily as I had done.

```python
df = pd.DataFrame()
df['X_time_of_day'] = X_time_of_day
df['y_train'] = y_train
# y_train.shape
```

Here below, just sampling 10k , for the `5` different period of times of day, 
there looks to be a high regularity. These time periods were selected kind of arbitrarily and maybe there are other choices that perhaps highlight diffences better. But for these selections, visually they have limited distinction.


```python
sample = np.random.choice(range(df.shape[0]), int(1e4))
df.iloc[sample].shape
```

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 16))
howmany = int(1e4)

def sample_foo(df, howmany):
    sample = np.random.choice(df.index.tolist(), howmany)
    return df.loc[sample]

time_of_day_map = {0: '6a-9a', 
                   1: '10a-1p', 2: '2p-4p', 
                   3: '5p-9p', 4: '10p-5a'}
base = 0
y1 = sample_foo(df[df['X_time_of_day'] == base], howmany)['y_train']

for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    y2 = sample_foo(df[df['X_time_of_day'] == i], howmany)['y_train']
    ax = fig.add_subplot(int('51' + f'{i + 1}'))
    ax.hist(y1, 
            bins=100, density=True, alpha=0.2, label=f'time_of_day={base}')
