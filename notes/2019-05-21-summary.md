### Citibike Project: Can your Destination be Predicted

#### Motivation
I think sometimes the most interesting projects live behind ideas that sound impractical or even crazy. That's why I thought
it would be fun to use the Citibike bike share trip data to try and predict a person's destination based on what we know.

_Roughly speaking trip data looks like this_

```
"tripduration","starttime","stoptime","start station id","start station name","start station latitude","start station longitude","end station id","end station name","end station latitude","end station longitude","bikeid","usertype","birth year","gender"

The data if fairly clean and regular, so I thought this was a fun data set to sharpen my teeth on.

#### Quick summary of the journey
* First started just [looking](#more-on-this-data) at this data.
* Just out of curiosity, as a first mini starter project I decided to look at the [relationship between rider age and speed](#speed-and-age)
* I realized pretty early that the bike station target was too small, so I started using the Google Geolocation API to get broader location data such
as _zip codes_ and _neighborhoods_ .
* I also thought on a high level that knowing whether you got on your bike at `4:05` in the afternoon versus `4:06` shouldn't 
influence my learning algorithm, so I added some more [transformations](#time-bucketing).

#### More on this data
* When I started looking at this data, there were 400+ stations for docking your citibike.
* There is age, and some of the riders were actually born in the 1800s, which is kind of cool.

#### Speed and Age
Turns out that you need to know the miles per the longitude degree at a particular latitude on our planet. So for our particular location, 
at lat around `40.723` 
(More on the code [here](https://github.com/namoopsoo/learn-citibike/blob/master/bikelearn/utils.py#L86) )

#### Need additional location data
* With the 400+ stations,
